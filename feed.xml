  &lt;p&gt;Pairing is the best way to improve your code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd heard this from a Ben
Orenstein talk this week, where he referenced another developer and surmised
that pairing with both those of less skill and more skill than you is a great
way to improve yourself as a developer. With 3 pairing sessions down, I'm already
starting to find myself in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first session was with Rachelle, and we had a look at working on the testing
and feature development of an existing application she was working on as part of
the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Coder-Club/"&gt;Brisbane Coder Club&lt;/a&gt;. Rachelle
and I have been friends for some time, so this session was awesome for just
getting into the groove and working on some features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was Kevin, who is working on some really interesting translation
software, whilst I struggled to grasp fully all the moving parts of his gem and
application, he was exceedingly patient and generous with his time and
knowledge. Together we looked for perfomance gains in the gem, as well as trying
to determine how to optimise an import task he had put together. It really
helped to encourage me to stay in the uncomfortable zone and embrace my lack of
knowledge as an opportunity to learn more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac, from Chicago and I got the ball rolling on some initial planning and
construction of his track application. Whilst we had a few technical issues, he
too was extremely patient and generous with his time. I really appreciated the
time he took to explain the domain, which enabled me to assist him with the
early planning, and work on the tests and features together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location so far, has not been an issue, and thankfully (horrible upload speeds
be damned), I've been able to work on my pairs machines so far. What has been
interesting with the varied locations, is the varying life experiences,
backgrounds and entry into Ruby of the 3 participants, making those connections
is frankly, awesomesauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward I will be adjusting the program slightly, as I'm looking to
encourage more people to work with me on my own project if they're interested so
I don't only spend x no of hours on theres from a week to week basis. If this is
something that interests you, please, get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank Rachelle, Kevin and Isaac for being such awesome pairs, and
will update here again soon with how the next sessions went.&lt;/p&gt;
